## Overview
This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the
Lead Capture Application
---
## Critical Fixes Implemented
### 1. Duplicate Email Function Calls
**File**: `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed
#### Problem
The form submission handler was calling the email confirmation function twice, leading to:
- Duplicate confirmation emails sent to users
- Wasted API calls and resources
- Confusion for users receiving multiple emails
#### Root Cause
The `handleSubmit` function contained two identical `supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', {...})` calls in sequence.
#### Fix
Removed the duplicate email function call, keeping only one invocation:
```typescript
// Removed duplicate call
const { error: emailError } = await supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', {
  body: { name, email, industry }
});
```
#### Impact
- ✅ Single confirmation email per submission
- ✅ Reduced API usage and costs
- ✅ Better user experience

### 2. Missing Database Insertion
**File**: `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed
#### Problem
Form submissions were only sending confirmation emails but not saving lead data to the database, resulting in:
- Lost lead information
- No data persistence
- Inability to track or follow up with leads
#### Root Cause
The form handler was missing the database insertion operation before calling the email function.
#### Fix
Added database insertion before email sending:
```typescript
// First, save the lead to the database
const { error: dbError } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .insert({
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    industry: formData.industry,
  });

if (dbError) {
  console.error('Error saving lead to database:', dbError);
  return;
}
```
#### Impact
- ✅ Lead data properly stored in database
- ✅ Data persistence and tracking capability
- ✅ Foundation for lead management system

### 3. OpenAI API Response Index Error
**File**: `supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Fixed
#### Problem
The Edge Function was trying to access the wrong index in the OpenAI API response, causing:
- Email content generation failures
- Fallback to generic content instead of personalized emails
- Poor user experience with non-personalized communications
#### Root Cause
The code was accessing `data?.choices[1]?.message?.content` instead of `data?.choices[0]?.message?.content` for the first response.
#### Fix
Corrected the array index to access the first choice:
```typescript
// Fixed from choices[1] to choices[0]
return data?.choices[0]?.message?.content;
```
#### Impact
- ✅ Personalized email content generation working
- ✅ Better user engagement through customized messages
- ✅ Proper AI-powered personalization functionality
